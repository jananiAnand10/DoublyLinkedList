# DoublyLinkedList

This repository contains an implementation of a Doubly Linked List in Java providing a comprehensive set of operations and utility methods. A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains data and two pointers: one pointing to the next node and one to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions.

Key Features:

Basic Operations:
Insertion: Add nodes at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
Deletion: Remove nodes from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Traversal: Iterate through the list in forward or reverse order.

Advanced Methods:
Swap Pairs: Swap every two adjacent nodes in the list.
Palindrome Checker: Check if the elements of the list form a palindrome.
Swap First and Last: Swap the first and last nodes of the list.
Reverse: Reverse the order of the nodes in the list.
